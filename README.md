## Abstract
Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) requires accurate input data such as floor counts and window-to-wall ratios (WWR), which are often missing from public datasets (e.g., OpenStreetMap). This project introduces a deep learning-based computer vision pipeline that automatically extracts these features from street-level façade imagery and integrates them into the City Energy Analyst (CEA) platform for urban-scale energy simulations.
